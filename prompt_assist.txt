I am presently an Associate Professor at the School of Computing at the Australian National University (ANU), Canberra, Australia. My research is focused on data management, analysis, and algorithms, partic- ularly on graph-structured data.\nI have known Teik Hun Ang since September 2021, when he was an undergraduate student in an introductory database course (COMP2400 Relational Databases) and I was the course lecturer. In this course, he very quickly achieved a solid understanding of both the bigger picture of the theoretical foundation and the specific practical skills he would need to accomplish. Teik Hun Ang was one of the top students in this course and he received an outstanding mark 92 out of 100.\nIn 2022, we were fortunate to have Teik Hun Ang as a tutor to help with this course. In particular, Teik Hun Ang helped to interact with students and deliver labs/tutorials. Teik Hun Ang's tutorials were very well prepared and delivered. He was easily approachable to our students and was eager to help them learn better. His tutoring effort was recognized by unanimous satisfactory feedback from students in his tutorials. Teik Hun Ang is an excellent team player, both as a leader (e.g., leading labs/tutorials) and partner (e.g., in collaborative tasks such marking). He has worked effectively with the course convenor, other tutors and me in this course. We truly enjoyed working with Teik Hun Ang.\nIn summary, I strongly recommend Teik Hun Ang for your organisation. Do not hesitate to contact me if you should need any additional information.\nBest regards,\nQing Wang 6mg\n1
